# 3D Model Optimization Strategies

Advanced optimization techniques for web-ready 3D models.

## Polygon Reduction

### 1. Decimate Modifier (Automatic)
Best for: Organic shapes, detailed models

```python
decimate = obj.modifiers.new(name='Decimate', type='DECIMATE')
decimate.ratio = 0.5  # 50% reduction
decimate.use_collapse_triangulate = True
```

### 2. Manual Retopology
Best for: Character models, hero assets
- Tools: Quad Draw, PolyBuild, Shrinkwrap modifier
- Target: Clean edge loops, optimized topology

### 3. Normal Map Baking
Best for: Static props, architecture

```python
# Bake high-poly detail to normal map
# Apply to low-poly model in web engine
```

## Texture Optimization

### 1. Texture Atlasing
Combine multiple textures into one large texture

Benefits:
- Fewer draw calls
- Better performance
- Smaller total file size

### 2. Texture Compression
- Use JPEG for diffuse maps (lossy, smaller)
- Use PNG for alpha/normal maps (lossless)
- Target resolution: 512-1024px

### 3. MIP Mapping
Auto-generated by web engines
- Smaller textures for distant objects
- Better performance, reduced aliasing

## File Size Reduction

Target sizes:
- Small props: <100 KB
- Character models: 500 KB - 1 MB
- Environment assets: 1-5 MB

Strategies:
1. Draco compression (60-90% reduction)
2. Lower texture resolution
3. JPEG instead of PNG
4. Reduce polygon count
5. Remove unused data

## Performance Targets

- Triangles: <50,000 per model
- Draw calls: Minimize (texture atlases, instancing)
- Texture memory: <50 MB total
- Load time: <2 seconds
