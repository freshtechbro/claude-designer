  "description": "Physics-based animation library combining React Spring (spring dynamics, gesture integration, 60fps animations) and Popmotion (low-level composable animation utilities, reactive streams). Use when building fluid, natural-feeling UI animations, gesture-driven interfaces, physics simulations, or spring-loaded interactions. Triggers on tasks involving React Spring hooks, spring physics, inertia scrolling, physics-based motion, animation composition, or natural UI movements. Alternative physics approach to motion-framer for more physically accurate animations.",
